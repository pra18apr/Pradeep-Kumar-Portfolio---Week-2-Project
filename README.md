# Pradeep-Kumar-Portfolio---Week-2-Project

## Description

Visit my portfolio deployed website: 
https://pra18apr.github.io/Pradeep-Kumar-Portfolio---Week-2-Project/

This webpage is designed by me and will provide more information about me, it also includes a short bio, projects, and how to get in touch with me. Intended for view and use by potential employers.

## Usage

This webpage displays my portfolio of work and can showcase my skills and talents to employers looking to fill a part-time or full-time position. I believe this is an effective portfolio highlights that shows my strongest work as well as the thought processes behind it. Through this page potential employers can view the projects I have prepared and contact me through the same webpage.

## Learning Points

In this Challenge I have set myself up for future success by applying the core skills I've recently learned, such as, flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables.
